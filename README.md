# Rumor-stance-classification
In this project we had classified a set of Twitter posts discussing rumors
into either supporting, denying, questioning, or commenting on the
underlying rumors. We had proposed an LSTM-based sequential model
which takes in the sequences of source and their corresponding replies
tweets as input and gives stances for all the underlying tweets.
